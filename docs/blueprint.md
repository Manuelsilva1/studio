## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep green (#1B5E20) to convey growth and tranquility, suitable for a library app. This color contrasts well with a light background.
- Background color: Light green (#E8F5E9), a desaturated version of the primary color to maintain a connection but ensure readability and a clean aesthetic in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Lime green (#A5D6A7), an analogous color to the primary hue with less saturation, is suitable to call attention to key interactive elements without overpowering the page.
- Font pairing: 'Roboto' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Open Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use consistent and clear icons from a library like FontAwesome or Feather icons.
- Employ a grid-based layout with sufficient white space for readability.
